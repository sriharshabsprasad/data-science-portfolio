# Data Science Portfolio

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! This repository showcases a collection of 13 diverse and impactful machine learning projects spanning various domains, from healthcare predictions to real estate and customer churn analysis. These projects are designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, model development, and predictive analytics.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **Glucose Guardian ‚Äì Diabetes Prediction and Analysis** 
Analyzed the Pima Indian dataset to develop predictive models for diabetes diagnosis using regression techniques. Conducted data visualization, hypothesis testing, and feature importance analysis to understand the impact of clinical variables. Insights from the study can help in early detection and intervention of diabetes risk among women.
