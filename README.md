# Data Science Portfolio

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! This repository showcases a collection of 13 diverse and impactful machine learning projects spanning various domains, from healthcare predictions to real estate and customer churn analysis. These projects are designed to demonstrate my skills in data analysis, machine learning, model development, and predictive analytics.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **Glucose Guardian ‚Äì Diabetes Prediction and Analysis**
Analyzed the Pima Indian dataset to develop predictive models for diabetes diagnosis using regression techniques. Conducted data visualization, hypothesis testing, and feature importance analysis to understand the impact of clinical variables. Insights from the study can help in early detection and intervention of diabetes risk among women.

### 2. **Brick by Brick ‚Äì Real Estate Price Prediction**
Developed machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to predict housing prices based on area, number of bedrooms, amenities, and furnishing status. Visualized feature impact and evaluated multiple models to identify the best-performing predictor. This solution aids real estate professionals in pricing strategy and investment decisions.

### 3. **Stay or Leave? ‚Äì Telecom Customer Churn Prediction**
Built a classification model to predict customer churn using telecom behavior and service data. Handled class imbalance with SMOTE and used Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost for model comparison. The model helps businesses proactively identify and retain at-risk customers.

### 4. **Popcorn Picks ‚Äì Movie Recommendation System**
Created a hybrid recommendation engine by combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering using MovieLens data. The system analyzes user behavior and movie metadata to provide personalized suggestions. Enhanced user experience through dynamic and accurate movie recommendations.

### 5. **ALS Segments ‚Äì Clustering ALS Patient Profiles**
Used KMeans clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction to segment ALS patients into meaningful subgroups. Explored patterns in disease progression to support personalized treatment planning. Results aid researchers and medical professionals in understanding variability in ALS development.

### 6. **Retail Radar ‚Äì U.S. Retail Sales Forecasting**
Performed time series analysis and forecasting on monthly U.S. retail sales using Prophet and linear regression models. Detected seasonal trends and anomalies to guide business decisions in marketing and inventory planning. Improves forecasting accuracy and strategic retail planning.

### 7. **Review Rater ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews**
Implemented NLP models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost on movie reviews to classify sentiments. Utilized TF-IDF and text preprocessing to extract key linguistic features. Enables content producers to gauge audience feedback and sentiment trends.

### 8. **Digit Detective ‚Äì MNIST Digit Classification**
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy. Performed image preprocessing, data visualization, and confusion matrix analysis. Project demonstrates core computer vision techniques and neural network design.

### 9. **LendSense ‚Äì Loan Disbursal Risk Prediction**
Created predictive models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN to classify loan applicants based on default risk. Applied grid search and feature engineering to optimize performance. Supports financial institutions in automating and de-risking loan approval processes.

### 10. **Diabetes Analyzer in R**
Used R to analyze diabetes risk across three datasets, performing data integration, visualization, and pattern recognition. Derived correlations between health parameters and diabetes probability. This project highlights how statistical modeling in R can uncover health insights.

### 11. **AirAware ‚Äì Air Quality Health Impact Classification**
Analyzed the relationship between pollution levels (PM2.5, NO2, CO) and hospitalization rates to predict health risks. Developed models using LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest to classify risk levels. Findings support public health efforts and policy-making to mitigate air pollution effects.
